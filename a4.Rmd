## Overview
The package I reviewed is called "covid", created and maintained by Chenjie Gong. The package is neatly formed with 10 folders, several essential files and importantly, licensed with GPL-3.

`covid` package touches on three aspects of a package's capability with its multi-dimensional usage. With the dataset obtained from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE), Chenjie combines it to `covid` package and makes it available, shareable in R. A shiny application named "COVID-19 TRACKER" made by Chenjie earlier is also built with the same dataset. "COVID-19 TRACKER" is subsequently merged with `covid` package, so we can access the app through `covid` package. 8 functions are contained in `covid` where most of them can be used intuitively in the console, while others seem to be more suitable to incorporate with the code in app.R file. The package as a whole is designed to facilitate the exploration of Covid-19 condition worldwide.
Chenjie successfully uses version control that the entire package is hosted on github, which enables a high level of transparency and resproducibility.

## What did I think this package would do? Did it do it?
<h4>Structure</h4>
The folders and files altogether fulfill each of their purpose well. 
First, the required fields in DESCRIPTION are all filled with appropriate responses that I can immediately grasp the general idea of this package. All packages, either required or recommended, are clearly listed in "Dependencies" section that I didn't encounter any issue having to install other packages after installing `covid`. 
Speaking of package installation, Chenjie explains the instructions for loading the package, step-by-step in README files in detail. Besides, examples of the output are clearly displayed. 
Following on documentation, a vignette is placed inside the "vignettes" folder. Nevertheless, the contents of the vignette differs a little from what I think as Chenjie focuses on describing the dataset and how it can be manipulated to make plots. My point of view on this is to concentrate more about the app or the package functionality. Yet it is interesting to spot this discrepancy as I start thinking that incorporating some demonstrations on the use of data as Chenjie did might enrich the overall contents more. 
The contents of _pkgdown.yml and pkgdown.yaml located in .github folder both align with my understanding of what is to be included. Specifically, it is fun to see some elements are customised such as the cerulean theme.
The remaining folders (tests, R, man, data, data-raw and inst) all contain the relevant and proper files. For instance, the R files built for the 8 functions and 1 dataset have successfully created their respective .Rd files in man folder. In addition, the original `coronavirus.csv` in data-raw  also has its .rda file in data folder.
The documentation structure is well formatted with roxygen2 which makes the reading easy and clear.
Therefore, most of the features in `covid` package are consistent with my knowledge of the package structure.

<h4>Functions</h4>
Taking in the dataset and one of the categories of Covid-19 measurements("cases_new", "deaths_new" and "recovered_new"), `type_select` integrates with `selecttype` function to produce the chosen category.
`plot_theme` serves as a theme generator that wraps the plots with specified theme.
The usage for `plot_cases` is reflected in the app.R where it plots the new cases number according to users' selected country.
Having the dataset as the only input, `n_countries` counts the distinct countries involved in `coronavirus` dataset.
As the function name indicates, `launch_app` itself would directly launch the "COVID-19 TRACKER" app generated by app.R, without any input.
Bounded by the minimum and maximum dates of the date range, `selectdate` seems to allow a date to be selected.
`countryinput` acts as a collection of countries which is adopted to the drop-down list for selection and is further integrated with the table.
Consisted of several categories of Covid-19 measurements("cases_new", "deaths_new" and "recovered_new"), `count_type` sums up the total number with the given date and the specified
category in the input.
